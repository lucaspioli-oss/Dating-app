      <li><strong>Profile Analysis:</strong> The ability to analyze dating profiles (via screenshots or text) to provide contextually relevant conversation suggestions.</li>
      <li><strong>Conversation Context:</strong> The App reads clipboard content (when you paste within the keyboard) to understand conversation context and generate appropriate responses.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Service is designed to assist and inspire your conversations. It does not guarantee any particular outcome in your dating interactions.</p>

    <!-- 3 -->
    <h2 id="s3">3. Eligibility</h2>
    <div class="warning-box">
      <p><strong>Age Requirement:</strong> You must be at least <strong>18 years of age</strong> to use Desenrola AI. By using this App, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- 4 -->

      <li>Maintain and update your account information to keep it accurate;</li>

    <!-- 5 -->
    <h2 id="s5">5. Subscription Terms and Billing</h2>

    <h3>5.1 Subscription Plans</h3>
    <p>Desenrola AI operates on a <strong>subscription-based model</strong>. We offer the following auto-renewable subscription plans:</p>
    <table>
      <tr><th>Plan</th><th>Billing Cycle</th><th>Renewal</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Weekly</td><td>Every 7 days</td><td>Automatic</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Monthly</td><td>Every 30 days</td><td>Automatic</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Yearly</td><td>Every 365 days</td><td>Automatic</td></tr>
    </table>

    <h3>5.2 Auto-Renewable Subscriptions</h3>
    <p>All subscriptions are <strong>auto-renewable</strong>, meaning they will automatically renew at the end of each billing period unless you cancel before the renewal date. Key details:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Payment is charged to your Apple ID account or Google Play account at confirmation of purchase;</li>
      <li>Your subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period;</li>
      <li>Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period;</li>
      <li>The renewal price will be the same as the original subscription price, unless we notify you of a price change in advance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.3 Managing Your Subscription</h3>
    <p>You can manage and cancel your subscription at any time through your device's settings:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Apple (iOS):</strong> Go to Settings &gt; [Your Name] &gt; Subscriptions &gt; Desenrola AI &gt; Cancel Subscription;</li>
      <li><strong>Google (Android):</strong> Go to Google Play Store &gt; Menu &gt; Subscriptions &gt; Desenrola AI &gt; Cancel Subscription.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Canceling your subscription will stop future renewals, but you will retain access to the Service until the end of your current billing period. Deleting the App from your device does <strong>not</strong> automatically cancel your subscription.</p>

    <h3>5.4 Free Trial</h3>
    <p>We may offer free trial periods from time to time. If a free trial is offered, it will automatically convert to a paid subscription at the end of the trial period unless you cancel before the trial ends. Any unused portion of a free trial will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription.</p>

    <!-- 6 -->
    <h2 id="s6">6. Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>All purchases and subscription payments are processed and managed by <strong>Apple (App Store)</strong> or <strong>Google (Play Store)</strong>. Refund requests are handled entirely by Apple or Google in accordance with their respective refund policies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Apple:</strong> You may request a refund through <a href="https://reportaproblem.apple.com" target="_blank">reportaproblem.apple.com</a> or by contacting Apple Support;</li>
      <li><strong>Google:</strong> You may request a refund through the Google Play Store or by contacting Google Play Support.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Desenrola AI does not process payments directly and therefore cannot issue refunds. All billing inquiries should be directed to Apple or Google, as applicable.</p>
